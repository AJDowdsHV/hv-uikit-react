      Hitachi Design System initiative produces reusable patterns and captures
      common methodologies, reducing design and implementation effort. It stands
      as a catalyzer for design alignment and governance across the organization,
      generating a unique and characteristic design language, capable of
      positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patterns divide themselves into two groups core and lab. 
      Core patterns are already aligned with design system expectations. 
      Lab patterns are being worked on and may not be yet aligned with design system expectations 
      so use them with care.
