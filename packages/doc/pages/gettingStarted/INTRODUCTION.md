## UI-Kit React
This UI Kit provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable React components to build their applications.

It enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

The UI Kit components are divided in three groups:
 - **Core** - *v%CORE_VERSION%* - components that are fully compliant with Design system guidelines and UI Kit best practices.
 - **Lab** - *v%LAB_VERSION%* - components contributed by external teams for specific use cases and not fully compliant with Design System guidelines, so use it carefully.
 - **Icons** - *v%ICONS_VERSION%* - icons provided by Design System, wrapped in React Components
    
#### Design System
Hitachi Design System initiative produces reusable patterns and captures common methodologies, reducing design and implementation effort.

It stands as a catalyzer for design alignment and governance across the  organization, generating a unique and characteristic design language, capable of positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.

#### These are features planned for the next release:
- upgrade our main dependency Material UI to its latest version 4.x.
- api cleanup, removing deprecated properties of our components.
- remove deprecated components (core and lab).
- better support for Typescript.
