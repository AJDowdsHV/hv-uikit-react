# The UI Kit initiative

The **UI Kit initiative** is a collaboration with the Engineering group and the Design System team, that produces a world class **User Interface framework** for a rewarding, coherent and inclusive User Experience throughout the Hitachi portfolio.

As a part of the Product Design group, the **Design System** team is responsible for collaborating with Product teams, in order to define and curate **reference Design patterns**, **guidelines**, and **methodologies**, producing **reusable patterns** that will reduce design and implementation effort, and stands as a catalyser for design alignment and governance across the organisation. This will generate a unique and characteristic **Design Language**, capable of positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.

The **UI Kit** will then apply those standards, creating and providing to the front-end developers & engineers a collection of **reusable React components** to build their applications, that guarantees the alignment with the Design System specifications. It will enable developers to use a consistent markup, styles, and behavior, both in prototype and production work.
