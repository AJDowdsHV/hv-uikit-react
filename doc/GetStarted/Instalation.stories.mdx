# Install UI Kit React

<br />

### npm registry

Our packages are being published to an <b>Hitachi Vantara npm registry</b>. If you want to use this project please make sure you have _.npmrc_ config file with one of the following lines:

```
@hv:registry=https://repo.orl.eng.hitachivantara.com/artifactory/api/npm/uikit-npm-release-orl/
```

Please check that your npmrc has this by running `npm config ls -l`; otherwise you can add it to the config by running `npm config edit`, or the installation step below will not work.

### Installation

- core - `npm install @hv/uikit-react-core`
- lab - `npm install @hv/uikit-react-lab`
- icons - `npm install @hv/uikit-react-icons`

To always have the latest development version of the UIkit, even before a release, you may want to use npm with the `latest` tag.

#### global link

If you need to work on a component and watch the changes reflected on your application at the same time, you can [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) your packages globally:

```sh
npm run link
```

It will create a symlink in the global folder {prefix}/lib/node_modules/{package} for each package.

### Getting Started

Install root dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

#### bootstrap

Bootstrap the packages in the current repo. Installs all their dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.

```sh
npm run bootstrap
```

#### storybook

It will startup the UI Development Environment [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). There you can see a list of the available components.

```sh
npm run doc
```
