# The UI Kit initiative

The **UI Kit initiative** is a collaboration with the Engineering group and the Design System team, that produces a world class **User Interface framework** for a rewarding, coherent and inclusive User Experience throughout the Hitachi portfolio.

As a part of the Product Design group, the **Design System** team is responsible for collaborating with Product teams, in order to define and curate **reference Design patterns**, **guidelines**, and **methodologies**, producing **reusable patterns** that will reduce design and implementation effort, and stands as a catalyser for design alignment and governance across the organisation. This will generate a unique and characteristic **Design Language**, capable of positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.

The **UI Kit** applies those standards, creating and providing to the front-end developers & engineers a collection of **reusable React components** to build their applications, that guarantees the alignment with the Design System specifications. It will enable developers to use a consistent markup, styles, and behavior, both in prototype and production work.

Here's a diagram of where the UI Kit sits regarding the Design System, Design Delivery and Engineering teams:

### The UI Kit structure

The UI Kit can be used via the following **six packages**:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Themes</b> - v{themesPackage.version} - Theme specifications according to the Design System
    Style guides, which include Colors, Typography definitions and Spacings for the Grid elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Icons</b> - v{iconsPackage.version} - The icon library provided by the Design System team,
    wrapped in React Components.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Core</b> - v{corePackage.version} - The main package, where the React components that are{" "}
    <b>fully compliant</b> with Design system guidelines and UI Kit best practices reside.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Lab</b> - v{labPackage.version} - React components <b>contributed by external teams</b> for
    specific use cases and <b>not fully compliant</b> with the Design System guidelines.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Code Editor</b> - v{codeEditor.version} - A wrapper to the <b>React Monaco editor</b>{" "}
    (https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor) compliant with the Hitachi Vantara
    Design System Style guidelines.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Compat</b> - v{compatPackage.version} - A compatibilituy package where components that are
    being removed from the library temporarily reside to allow the teams that are using them to plan
    their substitution. Not for all components but those that might require more time to be replaced
    and would cause more disruption to the teams' work.
  </li>
</ul>

## Components, Widgets and Templates

While the UI Kit is a component library, we also provide Widgets and Templates. Here's a run down of what's what:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Components:</b> UI Kit components are the building blocks for creating your apps. They
    correspond (in most cases) to Design System patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Widgets:</b> UI Kit widgets usually correspond to Design System patters but sit a level above
    the components. A pattern might result in an infinity of possible configurations for the
    component. So much so that it would be impractical to develop a component that contemplated all
    the possibilities. That's where widgets come in: we provide a set of widgets that the teams can
    copy to their project and adapt as per their requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Templates:</b> UI Kit provides a list of templates with common use cases found along Hitachi
    Vantara's portfolio to help teams accelerate development of their apps. You can find a list of
    templates{" "}

    </a>
    .
  </li>
</ul>

## Accessibility

The **UI kit** follows the two most commonly encountered conformance guidelines for accessibility. They are:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> - Globally accepted
    standard
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> - US federal agencies
  </li>
</ul>

WCAG 2.0 has 3 levels of conformance; A, AA and AAA (in order of conformance). As meeting WCAG 2.0 level AA guidelines also meets the Section 508 standards, this is likely the standard that most organizations will want to target.

Regarding the usage of the our components, the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) provides valuable insight on how to make our components highly accessible.

To make sure our developed components follow the recommendation in the WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 guidelines, we target our development and tests to meet these two standards. Since many of our components are custom built,
there is always room for improvement or areas where the accessibility of a component can be improved. If there is any component where you think improvements can be made, please reach out to us.

Even though we're focused on developing a component library that is compliant with these standards, the application in which the components are integrated into has the responsibility of ensuring that the individual components are configured correctly and that the integration of those components produce an accessible application.
So it is very important to know that the **UI kit enables the development of standard compliant applications, nothing more**.
