# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.

<br />

## Our priorities

- **Design System Update:** The Design System, like the UI Kit, is a living project, which means patterns and themes evolve. Since our goal is to speed up the Hitachi application ecosystem development, alignment with the guidelines is a priority for us. This enables teams to fully leverage the new guidelines just by using the UI Kit and our new releases.

- **Accessibility:** Our components follow the recommendation in the WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 guidelines, we target our development and tests to meet these two standards.

- **New Components and Features:** New patterns and features to existing patterns are being actively added. Our goal, along with the other priorities, is to make sure we implement those components/features on our side.

- **Promote Components from Lab to Core:** The Lab section works as an incubator for components that are not ready yet to move to the Core library and exposes all the external contributions. 

- **Localization and i18n:** Although the setup of the i18n should happen at the application layer, our components are configurable in order to react to the labels the application manages. The UI Kit also provides utilities to:
  - format numbers according to the Design System Guidelines and locales;
  - dates according to the Design System Guidelines and locales.

- **Responsiveness:** Most of our patterns are adjustable to the existent Grid System. We keep investing in making sure the components can behave correctly in responsive situations.

## Next Versions

### UI Kit v5

- **Upgrade to Next Design System:** In our continuous effort to keep the UI Kit library closely following the latest Design System Guidelines, we will upgrade all components to the Design System v5 and try to streamline the adoption of future versionsâ€‹.

- **White Labeling:** This is a major topic for us and we'll improve the customization experience and allow the UI Kit components to be easier customized.

- **Typescript:** Right now the typescript definitions the UI Kit library provides are manually authored. In the future we're moving to fully integrate Typescript in the library.
