# The UI Kit initiative

The **UI Kit initiative** is a collaboration between the **Engineering** group and the **Design System** team.

As a part of the **Product Design** group, the **Design System** team is responsible, collaborating with **Product** teams, to define and curate **reference Design patterns**, **guidelines** and **methodologies**, producing **reusable patterns** that will reduce design and implementation effort and will generate a unique, coherent and inclusive **[Design System](https://designsystem.hitachivantara.com/)**.

The **UI Kit** provides a collection of **reusable React components**, that guarantees the alignment with the Design System specifications, and stands as a catalyser for a consistent overall User Experience across Hitachi Vantara portfolio.​

## UI Kit Packages

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Themes</b> - v{themesPackage.version} - Theme specifications according to the Design System
    Style guides, which include Colors, Typography definitions and Spacings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Icons</b> - v{iconsPackage.version} - The icon library provided by the Design System team,
    wrapped in React Components.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Core</b> - v{corePackage.version} - The main package, where the React components that are{" "}
    <b>fully compliant</b> with Design system guidelines and UI Kit best practices reside.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Lab</b> - v{labPackage.version} - React components <b>not fully compliant</b> with the Design
    System guidelines or <b>contributed by external teams</b> for specific use cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Code Editor</b> - v{codeEditor.version} - A wrapper to the <b>React Monaco editor</b>{" "}
    (https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor) compliant with the Hitachi Vantara
    Design System Style guidelines.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Compat</b> - v{compatPackage.version} - A compatibility package where components that are
    being removed from the library temporarily reside to allow the teams that are using them to plan
    their substitution. 
  </li>
</ul>

## Components, Widgets and Templates

While the UI Kit is a component library, we also provide Widgets and Templates. Here's a run down of what's what:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Components:</b> UI Kit building blocks for creating your apps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Widgets:</b> A Pattern might result in an infinity of possible configurations for a
    component. So much so that it would be impractical to develop a component that contemplated all
    the possibilities. That's where widgets come in: we provide a set of widgets that addresses specif use cases, but users can
    copy them and adapt as per their requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Templates:</b> UI Kit provides a set of templates with common use cases found along Hitachi
    Vantara's portfolio to help teams accelerate the development of their apps. You can find a list of
    templates{" "}

    </a>
    .
  </li>
</ul>

## Accessibility

The **UI kit** follows the two most commonly conformance guidelines for accessibility. They are:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> - Globally accepted
    standard
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> - US federal agencies
  </li>
</ul>

WCAG 2.0 has 3 levels of conformance; A, AA and AAA (in order of conformance). As meeting WCAG 2.0 level AA guidelines also meets the Section 508 standards, this is likely the standard that most organizations will want to target.

Regarding the usage of the our components, the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) provides valuable insight on how to make our components highly accessible.

To make sure our developed components follow the recommendation in the WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 guidelines, we target our development and tests to meet these two standards. Since many of our components are custom built,
there is always room for improvement or areas where the accessibility of a component can be improved. If there is any component where you think improvements can be made, please reach out to us.

Even though we're focused on developing a component library that is compliant with these standards, the application in which the components are integrated into has the responsibility of ensuring that the individual components are configured correctly and that the integration of those components produce an accessible application.
So it is very important to know that the **UI kit enables the development of standard compliant applications, nothing more**.
