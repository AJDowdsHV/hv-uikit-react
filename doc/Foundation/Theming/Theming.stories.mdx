The UI Kit components come with two themes - **Wicked** and **Dawn**.

In order to have those themes available to the components, you will need to setup the `<HvProvider>` component at the root level of your app.

The **HvProvider** relies on the context feature of React to pass the theme down to the components, so every component or subcomponent enclosed by the **HvProvider** will be injected with a theme prop that contains the theme specs.

```
<HvProvider>
  <MyApp />
<HvProvider/>
```

# Overriding themes

The ui-kit theme object is an enhanced material-ui like theme object,
the basic structure of a material theme can be found in [here](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/).
Ui-kit appends to the material theme an `hv` property which contains extra definitions required for the components,
these definitions can be found in [here](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/blob/master/packages/themes/src/dawn.json).

Given the fact that the theme contains some utility functions, if you want to override one of the ui-kit themes you must built your custom theme first.
To do this you must import the theme builder function like this `import { themeBuilder } from "@hv/uikit-react-core/dist/theme";`.
The function receives a json object with the same structure as the definitions found in here [here](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/blob/master/packages/themes/src/dawn.json).
The themeBuilder will output a material theme object with the values received appended in the `hv` property ,
this theme then can be passed to the provider.

```
const myRawCustomTheme = {
  "palette": {
    "accent": {
      "acce0": "#33CE33",
    }
  }
}

const myCustomTheme = themeBuilder(myRawCustomTheme);

<HvProvider theme={myCustomTheme}>
  <MyApp>
<HvProvider/>
```
