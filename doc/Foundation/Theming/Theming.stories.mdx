## Theming

UI-Kit components come with two themes - **Wicked** and **Dawn**.  
In order to have those themes available to the components you need to setup the **HvProvider** component at the root level of your app.  
**HvProvider** relies on the context feature of React to pass the theme down to the components, so every component or subcomponent enclosed by the **HvProvider** will be injected with a theme prop that contains the theme specs.

```
<HvProvider>
  <MyApp />
<HvProvider/>
````

If you wish to customize the theme, you need to pass your custom theme to the HvProvider component.  
This theme value is a material-ui-like object that contains the definition of the various colors and spaces defined by design system. 

```
<HvProvider theme={mycustomTheme}>
  <MyApp>
<HvProvider/>
```
