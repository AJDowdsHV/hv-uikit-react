## Typography

The developer is responsible for loading all fonts needed by their application, since they will **not** be automatically loaded.

### Setup

UI-Kit uses **[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)** as the default font.

Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Open Sans font from a CDN:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400,500,600" />
```

### Typographies

<Preview>
  <Story name="Main">
    <Typographies />
  </Story>
</Preview>
